##  Game Development (Independent Projects)
I’ve been an **independent game developer** for several years, focusing on real-time 3D experiences and gameplay systems.  
- Built multiple prototype projects in **Unreal Engine 4/5** using Blueprint and C++.  
- Experimented with **environment design**, **AI behavior trees**, and **physics-based gameplay systems**.  
- Recently transitioned to **Unity** to expand into C# scripting and mobile-compatible workflows.  

While I haven’t released any commercial titles yet, I use game development as a way to refine my problem-solving, real-time rendering, and creative design skills.
